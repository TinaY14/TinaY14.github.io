                <h3>About This Dish</h3>
                <p>Scallion Pancakes (è‘±æ²¹é¥¼ or è‘±æŠ“é¥¼) are one of my absolute favorite street foods to recreate at home. These aren't actually pancakes in the Western sense, but rather flaky, layered flatbreads filled with fresh scallions and cooked until golden and crispy. Every bite delivers satisfying crunch and fresh onion flavor.</p>

                <h3>Essential Ingredients</h3>
                <p><strong>All-Purpose Flour:</strong> Forms the base of the dough</p>
                <p><strong>Hot Water:</strong> Creates a tender, pliable dough</p>
                <p><strong>Fresh Scallions:</strong> The star ingredient - green parts only</p>
                <p><strong>Salt:</strong> Enhances all the flavors</p>
                <p><strong>Sesame Oil:</strong> Adds nutty fragrance</p>
                <p><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> For layering and cooking</p>

                <h3>The Layering Technique</h3>
                <p>The secret to perfect scallion pancakes lies in the lamination process. I roll out the dough thin, brush with oil and seasonings, sprinkle with chopped scallions, then roll it up like a jelly roll. After coiling it into a spiral and resting, I roll it out again - this creates those beautiful, distinct layers.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>My Cooking Method</h3>
                <p>I cook them in a well-heated pan with a generous amount of oil, starting on medium-high heat to get that initial sear, then reducing to medium to ensure the inside cooks through without burning the outside. The key is patience - letting each side develop a golden, crispy crust.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>Personal Variations</h3>
                <p>Sometimes I add a pinch of five-spice powder to the oil mixture for extra warmth and complexity. I also like to include a few white parts of the scallions for added bite and texture. The contrast between the crispy exterior and tender, flaky interior is absolutely perfect.</p>

                <h3>Serving & Enjoyment</h3>
                <p>Best served immediately while still hot and crispy, these pancakes are perfect as a snack, breakfast, or side dish. I love dipping them in a simple sauce made with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of chili oil. They're also wonderful on their own!</p>

                <h3>Street Food Memories</h3>
                <p>These remind me of walking through night markets, watching vendors expertly roll and cook these pancakes to order. The sizzling sound, the aroma of scallions hitting hot oil, and that first crispy bite - it's pure comfort food that connects me to those wonderful street food experiences.</p>
