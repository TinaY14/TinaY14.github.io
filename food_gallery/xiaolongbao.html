                <h3>About This Dish</h3>
                <p>Xiaolongbao (Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖ), literally "small basket buns," are Shanghai's most famous culinary export. These delicate soup dumplings require precision and patience to create the perfect balance of tender wrapper, savory filling, and rich, hot broth all contained in one beautiful dumpling.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>The Secret: Aspic Broth</h3>
                <p><strong>Pork Stock:</strong> Made from pork bones, chicken, and aromatics</p>
                <p><strong>Gelatin Formation:</strong> Cooled stock becomes firm aspic</p>
                <p><strong>Filling Integration:</strong> Diced aspic mixed with seasoned ground pork</p>
                <p><strong>Steam Magic:</strong> Heat melts aspic back into delicious broth</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>Wrapper Technique</h3>
                <p>The wrapper (ÁöÆÂ≠ê) is crucial - it must be thin enough to be translucent yet strong enough to hold the soup. I roll each wrapper by hand, keeping the center slightly thicker than the edges for structural integrity. The pleating technique requires 18-20 folds for the authentic look.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>Filling Preparation</h3>
                <p><strong>Ground Pork:</strong> Fresh, with good fat content for juiciness</p>
                <p><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, white pepper</p>
                <p><strong>Ginger:</strong> Fresh minced ginger for warmth</p>
                <p><strong>Aspic Cubes:</strong> The key to the soup inside</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>Steaming Process</h3>
                <p>I steam them in traditional bamboo baskets lined with cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. The steaming process takes exactly 8-10 minutes - too long and the wrappers break, too short and the aspic won't melt completely. The result is a delicate dumpling filled with hot, flavorful soup.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>Eating Technique</h3>
                <p>The proper way is to carefully lift the xiaolongbao with chopsticks, place it on your spoon, make a small hole to release some steam, sip the soup, then enjoy the dumpling. It's an experience that combines taste, technique, and tradition.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Heritage</h3>
                <p>Originally from Shanghai, xiaolongbao represents the refined, subtle flavors of Jiangnan cuisine. Each dumpling is a work of art, showcasing the chef's skill and the rich culinary traditions of Eastern China.</p>
