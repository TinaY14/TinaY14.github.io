            <p>
                My name is Tina, and I have a growing interest in the field of nutrition. I’ve always been curious about the connection between what we eat and how it affects our overall health, energy, and long-term well-being. Learning how food choices can prevent disease, support healthy lifestyles, and improve quality of life motivates me to explore this subject more deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
                What excites me most about nutrition is that it combines science with practical everyday choices. I enjoy learning how biology, chemistry, and physiology all come together to explain how nutrients are absorbed and used in the body. At the same time, I find it inspiring to see how this knowledge can be applied in real life—whether through meal planning, public health education, or supporting individuals in reaching their health goals.
