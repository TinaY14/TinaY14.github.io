            <p>
                My name is Xitian (Tina) Yu, and I'm an Engineering Chemistry student at Stony Brook University with an expected graduation in 2029. I have a deep passion for nutrition and its impact on health and wellness, which has led me to actively engage with organizations like the American Society of Nutrition and Nutrition Facts Organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained high academic standards while pursuing diverse interests. I'm fluent in Chinese (native), with elementary proficiency in French and Spanish. My technical skills include programming in Python and C, along with various design and presentation tools. I hold CPR/AED First Aid Certification and have been recognized with multiple honors including annual honor rolls and the Researcher of the Year award.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I'm actively involved in leadership roles, serving as Director of Design for the Supernova Model United Nation Team and as Treasurer for the National Honor Society. I founded and captain a C-pop Dance Group, combining my love for Chinese culture with community building. My research experience spans from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to various competition projects, always driven by curiosity and the desire to make meaningful contributions to science and society.
