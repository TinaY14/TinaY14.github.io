                <h1>🍽️ What is Wolfie Dine?</h1>
                <p>Wolfie Dine is a student-run menu aggregator website for Stony Brook University dining halls, founded on January 22, 2025. It allows students to view all available meal options from different dining halls in one place and easily see dining hall hours. The data is sourced from Nutrislice, updated daily, and clearly references Nutrislice for detailed nutrition information and service alerts.</p>
                <p>As of February 7 at 10:00 AM, Wolfie Dine has reached over 2,000 unique visitors with a pull of 28.84k. We've earned a lot of cheers and thanks from the Stony Brook community!</p>

                <h1>💡 Why We Built It</h1>
                <p>Last semester, I noticed that many students frequently asked in group chats what each dining hall was serving or when it was open. While Nutrislice is helpful, it can sometimes be difficult to quickly compare menus across dining halls and decide where to eat.</p>
                <p>Over winter break, my friend Chenhao Yu (a Stony Brook sophomore) and I decided to build a solution. We wanted to create a simple, centralized place where students could see everything at a glance without having to check multiple sources.</p>

                <h1>🔧 How It Works</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aggregates menus from all Stony Brook University dining places into one page</li>
                    <li>Displays dining hall hours so students can plan their meals</li>
                    <li>Data is sourced from Nutrislice and updated daily</li>
                    <li>References Nutrislice and the Stony Brook Dining website for detailed nutrition information and service alerts</li>
                    <li>The website was built and maintained by students for students</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>👥 The Team</h1>
                <p>Wolfie Dine was co-founded by me and my friend Chenhao Yu. We built the site over 25-26 winter break and continue to maintain it. As a student-run project, we're committed to keeping it useful and up-to-date for the Stony Brook community.</p>
