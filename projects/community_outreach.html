                <h3>🥮 The Story Behind Mooncakes</h3>
                <p>Mooncakes are traditional Chinese pastries deeply rooted in the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration. This festival, also known as the Moon Festival, is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, symbolizing family reunion and harmony.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mid-Autumn Festival Tradition:</strong> Families gather to admire the full moon, share mooncakes, and celebrate togetherness. The round shape of mooncakes represents completeness and unity, making them essential to this cultural celebration.</p>

            <div class="content-entry">
                <h3>🤔 Research Motivation</h3>
                <p>I noticed a concerning trend: nowadays Chinese people are buying fewer and fewer mooncakes. This decline in a cherished tradition made me wonder - what's happening to this important cultural practice?</p>
                
                <p>To understand this phenomenon, I conducted a small survey asking people from different age groups across various places in China about their mooncake consumption habits and preferences.</p>

                <h3>📊 Survey Methodology</h3>
                <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interviewed people from different age groups</li>
                    <li>Included participants from various regions in China</li>
                    <li>Asked about purchasing habits and preferences</li>

                <h3>📈 Key Findings</h3>
                <p><strong>The Main Discovery:</strong> Most people are now more focused on keeping their bodies healthy, and they find mooncakes problematic because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mooncakes are too sweet for modern health-conscious preferences</li>
                    <li>They contain too many rich ingredients (oils, sugar, preservatives)</li>
                    <li>High calorie content conflicts with wellness goals</li>
                    <li>Younger generations prefer lighter, less processed foods</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Health Consciousness Impact:</strong> The survey revealed that the shift toward healthier eating habits is significantly influencing traditional food consumption patterns, even for culturally significant items like mooncakes.</p>
