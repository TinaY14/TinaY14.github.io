# 💡 Eating Tips

**Proper Technique:**
1. Let cool slightly (the soup inside is very hot!)
2. Bite a small hole in the side
3. Sip the hot, flavorful broth

The magic is in the gelatin that melts during cooking to create soup inside! Best enjoyed fresh from the pan at a Shanghai street stall. The crispy bottom contrasting with soft top and juicy filling is perfection!
