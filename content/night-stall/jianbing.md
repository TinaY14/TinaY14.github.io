Jianbing originated in Shandong province and has become one of China's most beloved breakfast foods. The batter is spread thin on a large griddle, an egg is cracked on top, and various fillings are added before folding. The crispy wonton cracker adds a delightful crunch. Each region has its own variation - some add lettuce, some use different sauces. It's best enjoyed fresh and hot from the street vendor!
