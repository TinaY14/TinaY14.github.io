# 🏛️ Cultural Connection

Rice wine (米酒) holds deep cultural significance in Chinese cuisine and tradition. This fermentation project explores the traditional methods of making Chinese rice wine while understanding the science and cultural importance behind this ancient beverage.

# 🔬 Project Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand fermentation process
- Learn traditional Chinese brewing techniques
- Explore microbiology of koji mold and yeast
- Experience hands-on traditional food preparation

**Results & Insights:**
Successfully produced traditional rice wine with characteristic sweet, mildly alcoholic flavor. The process required patience, precise temperature control, and understanding of fermentation biology.

# 🌾 Ingredients & Materials

**Main Ingredients:**
- Glutinous rice (sticky rice) - 2 cups
- Chinese rice wine starter (酒药/酒曲) - 1 ball
- Filtered water
- Clean, sterilized jar

**Equipment:**
- Large glass jar with lid
- Steamer or rice cooker
- Clean cloth
- Thermometer

# 🔬 Fermentation Process

**Step 1: Prepare the Rice**
1. Wash glutinous rice thoroughly
2. Soak overnight in cold water
3. Steam until fully cooked but not mushy
4. Cool to lukewarm (30-35°C)

**Step 2: Add Starter Culture**
1. Crush rice wine starter ball into powder
2. Mix thoroughly with cooled rice
3. Transfer to sterilized jar
4. Make a small well in center for liquid to collect

**Step 3: Fermentation**
1. Cover jar with clean cloth
2. Keep at warm temperature (25-30°C)
3. Ferment for 2-3 days
4. Liquid (rice wine) will collect in well

**Step 4: Secondary Fermentation (Optional)**
1. Add filtered water to jar
2. Seal and ferment additional 1-2 weeks
3. Strain and bottle

# 📊 Scientific Analysis

**Fermentation Science:**
- Koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) breaks down rice starches into sugars
- Yeast converts sugars into alcohol and CO2
- Temperature critical for proper fermentation
- pH changes indicate fermentation progress

**Nutritional Content:**
- Alcohol content: 2-8% depending on fermentation time
- Contains B vitamins from fermentation
- Probiotics beneficial for digestion
- Natural enzymes aid nutrient absorption
