# 🥮 What Are Mooncakes?

Mooncakes are traditional Chinese pastries enjoyed with family and shared during the Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as the Moon Festival). Their round shape resembles the full moon, representing completeness and unity, and symbolizing family reunion and harmony.

# 🤔 Why This Project?

I first came across a post on Rednote from a woman with diabetes who was asking for advice on what mooncakes she could eat. She explained that she couldn't find any good options because most mooncakes she saw were very high in sugar. I then saw another similar post in which a man with diabetes shared that he felt dizzy and had to inject insulin after taking only a small bite of a sugar-free mooncake.

At the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2025, I noticed that fewer people seemed to be buying mooncakes. This was further confirmed through conversations with visits to several supermarkets (there were still many mooncakes left on the shelves!) where I spoke with sales staff. Sales staff were concerned that these remaining mooncakes would quickly go to waste after the festival, since mooncakes are products with high demand only for a short period of time.

Back on social media, many posts expressed concerns about mooncakes becoming overly sweet. Some buyers even called on manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar used, saying that they were really disappointed with the current state of the mooncake industry and that this had reduced their willingness to purchase mooncakes in the following year.

This observation made me wonder what is causing this trend - is it really mainly due to the high sugar content?

# 📊 What Did I Do?

I conducted a survey and distributed it via two social media sites (rednote and WeChat), collecting responses from participants across different age groups and regions in China. The survey consisted of 15 questions and was designed to be completed in under 3 minutes. It examined consumers' purchasing habits and preferences regarding mooncakes in 2025.

Questions 8-12 asked participants to rate their level of concern (from 0-10, where 0 means no worries and 10 means very concerned) regarding different nutritional aspects: excess sugar content, fat/oil content, total calories, trans fatty acids, and food additives (such as preservatives). The table below shows the number of people who selected each rating from 0-10.

# 📈 Key Findings

- More than half of respondents reported that they or their family members needed to closely monitor sugar intake (e.g., due to diabetes, high blood sugar, or sugar-controlled diets).
- Out of 72 respondents, 37 indicated that they significantly reduced their mooncake consumption this year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, while 16 of them reported a slight reduction.
- Among those who reduced consumption, health concerns were the primary reason (27 respondents), followed by taste preferences (15 respondents).
- Most respondents paid attention to nutritional information and health labels on mooncake packaging.
- Concerns about food additives and preservatives were the most prominent, followed by concerns about trans fatty acids; other nutritional factors were also of notable concern.
- Regarding low-sugar or sugar-free mooncakes, most respondents expressed concerns about the safety and health effects of artificial sweeteners (e.g., xylitol).
- If mooncakes carried official health claims (e.g., low sugar, low fat, low sodium), most respondents were willing to pay a 5%–10% price premium.
- Many respondents also had a preference for less sugar, healthier ingredients, and simpler packaging overall.

# 🌏 My Personal Insights

This project began simply out of my own curiosity. With a small number of responses and the questions in the survey that weren't designed for scientific research, the results are not representative. However, this shows a simple way for me to engage with others and listen to their experiences, thoughts, and feelings around mooncakes and the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Looking through the responses, I realized how much the relationships between people and traditional food are evolving. Although mooncakes still carry a strong cultural meaning, many respondents talked about health, sugar intake, and ingredients before tradition. For some, this was because of personal health conditions; for others, it reflected the changing of lifestyles. These responses made me realize that traditions are changed slightly through individual choices.

On a personal level, this project felt less like collecting data and more like having conversations. It encouraged me to listen more closely and think more deeply about the ways culture and health intersect. I felt honored to hear these shared experiences to conduct this survey within a small group and in this short period.

If I had the chance to continue this project in the future, I would give it a more focused aim, more time, a larger group of participants, and a clearer structure. Even so, in its current form, it has already served its purpose: It helped me to learn, reflect, and connect.

# 🙏 Thank You

Lastly, I really want to thank everyone who took the time to fill out my survey. I learned so much from each answer. Many kind people on social media were open and generous. They were very willing to share their thoughts honestly even with someone who they didn't know.

I also appreciate to my family and friends for supporting me and helping me spread the survey. All the data was collected within just two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2025, which makes every response feel very precious. Along the way, I had many meaningful conversations with different people beyond the survey itself. It was my honor to hear their stories and perspectives. Thank you, I really appreciate this experience of hearing from all of you!
