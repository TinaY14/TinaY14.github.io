# 💡 Secret to Perfect Pancakes

- **Hot Water Secret:** Using hot water creates a softer, more pliable dough
- **Oil Paste:** This creates the flaky layers when rolled
- **Generous Scallions:** Don't skimp - they're the star of the show!
- **Proper Rolling:** Roll tightly for more layers
- **Medium Heat:** Too hot burns the outside before cooking inside
- **Serve Immediately:** Best enjoyed fresh and hot from the pan
