# 👩‍🍳 Baking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare for Baking**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
2. Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan or two 9-inch round pans
3. Mash the ripe bananas in a large bowl until smooth (some small lumps are okay)

**Step 2: Mix Wet Ingredients**

1. In the bowl with mashed bananas, add softened butter and mix well
2. Beat in both sugars until light and fluffy (about 3 minutes)
3. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition
4. Stir in vanilla extract

**Step 3: Combine Dry Ingredients**

1. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt
2. Add dry ingredients to the banana mixture alternating with buttermilk
3. Start and end with flour mixture, mixing just until combined
4. Don't overmix - this keeps the cake tender

**Step 4: Bake to Perfection**

1. Pour batter into prepared pan(s) and spread evenly
2. Bake for 25-30 minutes for round pans, 35-40 minutes for rectangular pan
3. Test with a toothpick - it should come out with just a few moist crumbs
4. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack

**Step 5: Optional Frosting**

1. Beat cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy
2. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until smooth
3. Add vanilla and beat until well combined
4. Frost cooled cake and enjoy!
