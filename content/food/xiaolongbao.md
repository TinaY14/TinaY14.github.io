# 💡 Expert Tips

- **Pleating Technique:** Practice makes perfect - aim for 18-20 pleats for authentic look
- **Soup Secret:** The gelatin stock melts during steaming to create the soup inside
- **Eating Method:** Bite a small hole first, sip the broth, then eat the dumpling
- **Wrapper Thickness:** Keep edges thin but center thick to prevent tearing
- **Timing:** Serve immediately - the soup cools quickly and loses its magic
