**Step 1: Prepare the Tofu**

1. Cut tofu into 2cm cubes, being gentle to maintain shape
2. Bring water to boil, add 1 tsp salt, and blanch tofu for 2 minutes

2. Add ground pork and cook until browned and crispy, breaking it up as it cooks
3. Push pork to one side of the wok

**Step 3: Build the Sauce**

1. Add remaining oil to the empty side of wok
2. Add minced garlic and ginger, stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant
3. Add doubanjiang (chili bean paste) and cook for 1 minute until oil turns red
4. Mix everything together in the wok

**Step 4: Combine and Simmer**

1. Pour in chicken stock, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce
2. Bring to a gentle boil, then carefully add the blanched tofu
3. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, gently stirring occasionally
4. Add cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce
5. Sprinkle ground Sichuan peppercorns and adjust seasoning

**Step 5: Final Touches**

1. Transfer to serving dish
2. Garnish generously with chopped green onions
3. Serve immediately with steamed rice

# 💡 Pro Tips
